Abstract 

Conclusive evidence that specific long-term memory formation relies on den- 
dritic growth and structural synaptic changes has proven elusive. Connec- 
tionist models of memory based on this hypothesis are confronted with the 
so-called plasticity stability dilemma or catastrophic interference. Other fun- 
damental limitations of these models are the feature binding problem, the 
speed of learning, the capacity of the memory, the localisation in time of an 
event and the problem of spatio-temporal pattern generation. This paper 
suggests that the generalisation and long-term memory mechanisms are not 
correlated. Only the development and the improvement of the feature ex- 
tractors in the cortex involves structural synaptic changes. We suggest the 
long-term memory has a separate mechanism which involves protein synthe- 
sis to encode the information into the structure of these proteins. A model of 
memory should be capable of explaining the difference between memorisation 
and learning. Learning has in our approach two different mechanisms. The 
generalisation in the brain is handled by the proper development of the links 
between neurons via synapses. The Hebbian learning rule could be applied 
only for this part of learning. Storing an internal firing pattern involves, in 
our approach, a new mechanism which puts the information regarding this 
firing pattern into the structure of special proteins in such a way that it 
can be retrieved later. The hypotheses introduced in this article includes a 
physiological assumption which has not been yet verified because it is not 
currently experimentally accessible.

2D > 2D Geometric Transformation Invariant 
to Arbitrary Translations Rotations and Scales 


Lucian Muresan * 


JINR, Dubna, Moscow Region. 141980 Russia 


Abstract. 


This paper presents a geometric transformation invariant to 
arbitrary translations, rotations and scales changes. The output contains 
only intrinsic information on the internal strncture of pattern consisting 
of pairs of angles. This approach does not use specific feature points of 
the curve as curvature maxima, torsion extrema or curvature discontinu- 
ity. The quasi-linearity feature of this transformation allows recognition 
of two or more images without segmentation. It also allows the recon- 
struction of image when a par~ of it is mis~ng or the recognition when 
extra noise curves are on the same scene.
